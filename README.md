# Worker-Allotment
Allot days for the workers keeping in mind certain conditions.

The requirements are as follows:
- Number of workers are variable (16-26 (for 4 regions))(differs for different regions)
- Some workers might take leave on specific days
- Some workers might need to be assigned work on specific days
- Some workers might need to be placed in a certain column (each day has many regions of work).
Have to fill the regions for each day giving maximum gap and everyone gets equal(as much as possible) spaces between 2 duties.
